                <p>Endangered animals are species at a high risk of extinction due to various factors, including habitat
                    loss, climate change, poaching, and pollution. The survival of these species is critical not only
                    for
                    biodiversity but also for the health of ecosystems. Conservation efforts are essential to protect
                    these
                    animals and ensure that they do not disappear from the planet.</p>
                <p>
                    The various reasons for endangerment include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poaching</li>
                    <li>Deforestation</li>
                    <li>Pollution</li>

                <header>Amur Leopard</header>
                <p>The Amur leopard, native to the temperate forests of the Russian Far East and northeastern China, is
                    one
                    of the most critically endangered big cats in the world. With a population estimated at fewer than
                    100
                    individuals, their numbers have dwindled due to poaching, habitat destruction, and prey depletion.
                    Their
                    beautiful, thick fur makes them a target for illegal hunting, and their habitats are increasingly
                    fragmented by human activities such as logging and development. Conservation efforts are focused on
                    habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and international cooperation to ensure their survival.

                <p>The Javan rhino, once widespread across Southeast Asia, now survives in just one location: Ujung
                    Kulon
                    National Park in Indonesia. With fewer than 75 individuals remaining, this species faces critical
                    threats from habitat loss, natural disasters, and potential disease outbreaks. Javan rhinos are
                    known
                    for their single horn and rugged, armor-like skin. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration,
                    strict protection measures, and scientific research to understand their behavior and needs better.
                    Efforts are also underway to explore potential sites for creating additional populations to reduce
                    the
                    risk of extinction.</p>

                <header>Hawksbill Turtle</header>
                <p>Hawksbill turtles are marine reptiles found in tropical coral reefs and coastal regions worldwide.
                    Recognizable by their distinctive pointed beaks and beautifully patterned shells, these turtles play
                    a
                    crucial role in maintaining the health of coral reefs. Unfortunately, they are critically endangered
                    due
                    to illegal trade in their shells, loss of nesting and feeding habitats, and accidental capture in
                    fishing gear. Conservation strategies focus on protecting nesting beaches, regulating fishing
                    practices,
                    and international agreements to curb illegal trade. Raising public awareness about the importance of
                    hawksbill turtles and the threats they face is also key to their preservation.</p>

                <p>The Sumatran orangutan is one of the two species of orangutans, native to the island of Sumatra in
                    Indonesia. With a population estimated at fewer than 14,000 individuals, they are critically
                    endangered
                    due to deforestation, illegal logging, and palm oil plantations that destroy their rainforest
                    habitat.
                    These great apes are known for their intelligence, reddish-brown hair, and remarkable ability to use
                    tools. Conservation efforts include protecting remaining forests, rehabilitating and reintroducing
                    orphaned and displaced orangutans, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Engaging local
                    communities in conservation activities is also crucial for the long-term survival of the Sumatran
                    orangutan.</p>

                <p>The vaquita, a small porpoise found only in the northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico, is
                    the
                    world's most endangered marine mammal. With fewer than 10 individuals remaining, primarily due to
                    bycatch in illegal gillnets used for fishing the totoaba fish, their situation is dire. Vaquitas
                    have a
                    unique appearance with dark rings around their eyes and mouth, earning them the nickname "panda of
                    the
                    sea." Conservation efforts focus on enforcing fishing regulations, removing gillnets from their
                    habitat,
                    and promoting alternative livelihoods for local communities. International cooperation and urgent
                    action
                    are needed to prevent the extinction of this elusive and critically endangered species.

                <p>Mountain gorillas inhabit the forests of the Virunga Mountains, which span the borders of Rwanda,
                    Uganda,
                    and the Democratic Republic of Congo. With only around 1,000 individuals remaining, they face
                    threats
                    from habitat loss, poaching, disease, and political instability. These gorillas are known for their
                    social behavior, living in family groups led by a dominant silverback male. Conservation efforts
                    include
                    anti-poaching patrols, habitat protection, and community-based tourism initiatives that provide
                    economic
                    benefits to local people while promoting gorilla conservation. Continued international support and
                    local
                    engagement are vital to ensure the survival of mountain gorillas.</p>

                <header>Saola</header>
                <p>The saola, also known as the "Asian unicorn," is one of the rarest and most mysterious animals on the
                    planet. Discovered in the forests of Vietnam and Laos in 1992, fewer than 100 individuals are
                    believed
                    to exist in the wild. Saolas are distinguished by their long, straight horns and white facial
                    markings.
                    They face severe threats from habitat loss due to deforestation and the pervasive use of snares set
                    by
                    poachers targeting other species. Conservation efforts are focused on habitat protection,
                    anti-poaching
                    measures, and research to learn more about this elusive animal. Given its critical status, the saola
                    requires urgent conservation attention to prevent its extinction.

                    world, endemic to the forests of the Philippines. Critically endangered with less than 400
                    individuals remaining, these eagles face threats from deforestation, habitat loss due to mining and
                    agriculture, and hunting. Conservation efforts involve establishing protected areas, community
                    education and engagement in conservation, and captive breeding programs to bolster wild populations
                    and ensure the survival of this iconic species.
